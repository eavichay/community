Raphaël Rougeron, one of the Web Components pioneers, along with his team created the Bosonic Project some while back. It was a very different approach to working with Web Components than x-tag and Polymer and it involved a required build step to create Web Components as close to specs as possible with minimal abstractions at runtime.

<!-- Excerpt -->

The approach gained a small but respectable following and unfortunately was overshadowed by Polymer Project, the Web Component library by Google. During that time Raphaël began to lose faith in Web Components and went through many personal trials. Now he has been inspired to revisit Bosonic and breathe new life into the project. Let’s welcome the return of Bosonic!
