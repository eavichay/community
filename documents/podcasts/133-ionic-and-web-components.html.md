Justin Willis from Ionic joins us this week to talk about hybrid app development with Ionic and some amazing work they have been doing with Web Components. Justin gives us an overview of the Ionic project, its background and how it makes building hybrid apps super easy. We then move on to talk about why Ionic have chosen to rebuild their components as Web Components and the benefits they are seeing from making this move.
