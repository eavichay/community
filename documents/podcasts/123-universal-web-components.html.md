Web Components Remote Conference is a two day conference all about Web Components. Jordan Last (@lastmjs) will be delivering a very interesting talk “Universal Web Components” which takes the idea of Web Components for GUIs, throws it out the window and then uses Web Components to control a drone instead! With the Custom Elements and Shadow DOM specifications settled on V1 and greater browser support than ever now is the perfect time to be investing in Web Components. This episode covers why Web Components are important, what challenges people face and some very interesting use cases for Web Components you probably never thought of.
