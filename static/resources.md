The WebComponents.org Resources section is a place to showcase useful tools and boilerplates to easily start hacking on your own custom elements.

# 1. Learn

Web Components is a set of specs that introduce powerful new capabilities to the web platform. Before getting started with your first custom element, it will be helpful to understand the scope of these new features. The [Introduction](/introduction) section contains an overview of these APIs. The [Community](/community) section is also a great way to catch up on the latest goings-on in the Web Components world. We’d also recommend starting out by reading the Getting Started sections of:
 * [Polymer's documentation;](https://www.polymer-project.org/)
 * [Slim.js's documentation.](http://slim.js.org/)
 * [Skate.js's documentation.](https://skatejs.netlify.com/)

These will give you an idea on how these libraries for building web components work and what might be best for you. Another incredible resource is the [web-components-todo repo](https://github.com/shprink/web-components-todo) which has the same to-do list app created in an ever growing list of web component and component compatible library methodologies. It's a great way to learn from the differences in techniques across libraries and see which one is right for your needs.

# 2. Create

Once you’ve learned about Web Components, it's time to create your own element! There are a number of different jumping-off points for getting started using a Web Component library, or just using the vanilla Web Component APIs directly:
 * [Polymer Boilerplate](https://github.com/webcomponents/polymer-boilerplate)
 * [VanillaJS Boilerplate.](https://github.com/webcomponents/element-boilerplate)

In these boilerplates, we solve the same problem using different libraries (Polymer / SkateJS / LitElement / SlimJS) or no library at all (VanillaJS), with the same tools and directory structure.

We encourage a series of best practices like setting up a live demo, documenting your API, maintaining a changelog for release purposes, and sharing your component on NPM. The boilerplates form small, opinionated starter-kits with all you need included, from polyfills to automated tasks.

You’ll still need to make some manual changes after forking each boilerplate, like changing an element's name in different files. In order to automate this process, we created a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) Generator and a [Slush](http://slushjs.github.io/#/) Generator that can scaffold a web component using the command-line:
 * [Element Generator for Yeoman](https://github.com/webcomponents/generator-element)
 * [Element Generator for Slush](https://github.com/webcomponents/slush-element)
 * [RHElement Generator](https://github.com/rhelements/generator-rhelement)

The generators help ensure an even more seamless start, helping with tasks like validating your element's name according to W3C's spec rules and checking if there's a similarly-named project on NPM.

Some projects also have command-line tools to help automate the scaffolding of web components and applications:
 * [Polymer CLI](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli) - CLI + build Polymer 3 & scaffold full applications
 * [StencilJS](https://www.stenciljs.com/) - CLI & Compiler to generate VanillaJS elements
 * [Web Component Factory](https://github.com/elmsln/wcfactory) - CLI to produce boilerplate VanillaJS, SlimJS, StencilJS, Polmer 3, LitElement

# 3. Share

Now that you’ve finished your element it's time to share it with the world! The web component ecosystem is growing quickly, and there are thousands of other developers out there who may benefit from your work.

The best way to share a component is by making it available for use with one of the current JavaScript package managers. Currently most web component libraries have great support for [Bower](https://bower.io/), and are working on improving support for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

And make sure to publish your element to webcomponents.org! Check out the [Publish page](https://webcomponents.org/publish) to learn how to publish your element.
